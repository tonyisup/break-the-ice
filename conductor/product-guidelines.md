# Product Guidelines

This document outlines the style, voice, and visual identity for the "Ice Breaker" application.

## Brand Messaging & Prose Style

*   **Voice and Tone:** The brand's voice is **Fun and Playful**. All in-app text, including the questions themselves, should reflect this.
*   **Language:** Use casual, accessible language. Emojis and lighthearted phrasing are encouraged to make the experience feel friendly and engaging.
*   **Objective:** The goal is to make users feel comfortable and excited to participate. Avoid overly formal, complex, or ambiguous language.

## Visual Identity

*   **UI Aesthetic:** The user interface should be **Sleek, Modern, and Intuitive**, as established in the project's README. It should support both Dark and Light modes.
*   **Color Palette:** The color scheme should be **Vibrant and Energetic**. Use bright, saturated colors to create a lively and exciting user experience that encourages interaction.
*   **Animations:** Animations and transitions, powered by Framer Motion, should be smooth and add to the dynamic feel of the application.
